#### ABOUT THE PLUGIN

This fun plugin adds two commands that allow players to measure their "penis," with the results displayed in the chat. The first use of something like this was by the well-known Slovak streamer [2SekundovyMato](https://www.youtube.com/@2SekundovyMato), who inspired this plugin.

**Plugin functionality:**

1. **Command `css_cicina`**:
   - This command, when entered in the game, randomly generates a penis size for the player.
   - If the player has used the command in the last 120 seconds, the command will not execute and the player will receive a message about the remaining time until they can use it again.
   - The randomly generated size (from 1.00 to 50.99 cm) is then displayed to all players on the server.

2. **Command `css_realcicina`**:
   - This command creates a penis size based on the player’s name rather than generating it randomly.
   - It uses a hash function (`playerName.GetHashCode()`) to generate a consistent penis size for each player based on their name.
   - Similarly to `css_cicina`, if the command has been used in the last 120 seconds, the player must wait before they can use the command again.
   - The penis size is displayed in the chat to all players as the "real" size.

This plugin allows measuring the "penis" either randomly or based on a consistent calculation from the player’s name, with both commands having a usage time limit.
